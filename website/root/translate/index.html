      <p>
         Snap Backup is an internationalized application &mdash; meaning that it is ready
         to be localized into different languages.&nbsp; However, translators
         are needed to convert the words from English into various other
         languages.&nbsp; If you want to help out, the process is
         straightforward.

      <h2>Make Snap Backup Work in Your Language</h2>

            <h3>Familiarize Yourself with Snap Backup</h3>
            <p>
               <a href=../download>Download</a> Snap Backup and use it a few times
               so you understand the basic operations.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <h3>Examine the Properties File</h3>
            <p>
               View the "<a href=https://github.com/snap-backup/snapbackup/blob/main/src/resources/properties/SnapBackup.properties class=external-site>Snap Backup
               properties file</a>"
               so you can see how Snap Backup stores the text displayed in the user
               interface.&nbsp; For example, the text for the "Exit" button in Snap
               Backup is defined with the following line:
            </p>
            <p class=indent><code>ButtonExit=Exit</code></p>
            <p>For the Portuguese version, the line would need to be changed to:</p>
            <p class=indent><code>ButtonExit=Sair</code></p>
            <p>The Chinese (Simplified) version would be:</p>
            <p class=indent><code>ButtonExit=退出</code></p>
            <p>The Farsi version would be:</p>
            <p class=indent><code>ButtonExit=ﻯﺩﺎﻋ ﻯﻭﺭﺭﺩ</code></p>
            <p>The Greek version would be:</p>
            <p class=indent><code>ButtonExit=Έξοδος</code></p>
            <p>The Korean version would be:</p>
            <p class=indent><code>ButtonExit=출구</code></p>
            <p>And the Hindi version would be:</p>
            <p class=indent><code>ButtonExit=निर्गम</code></p>
            <p>The actual text displayed on the screen for the "Exit" button depends on
            the language chosen by the user.</p>
         </li>

            <h3>Become Famous</h3>
            Well, we can't make you a rock star, but we will definitely give you
            <a href=../about>credit</a> in the Snap Backup "About" box for your
            translation work.&nbsp;

      <h2>Notes About Translating</h2>
      <p>
         It is best to edit and save your property file in
         <a href=https://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html
            class=external-site>Unicode (UTF-8 encoding)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         A line in the properties file beginning with the character "#" is a
         comment.
      </p>
      <p>
         The default fast key (mnemonic) for menu items and buttons is the first
         character of the displayed text.&nbsp;
         To designate a different character as the fast key, insert an "&" just before the
         character desired to be the fast key.
