   <section id=license>
      <h2>Is Snap Backup open source?</h2>
      <p>
         Yes, it's license under the
         <a href=https://github.com/snap-backup/snapbackup/blob/main/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.&nbsp;
         Everyone is free to use Snap Backup and even

   <section id=incremental>
      <h2>Does Snap Backup perform "incremental" backups or "full" backups?</h2>
      <p>
         Full.&nbsp;
         Incremental backups are good for many needs, like backing up an entire hard drive, but
         such an approach adds complexity to the backup process.&nbsp;
         Snap Backup is intended for people who just want to backup their data files not their
         entire hard drives.
      </p>
   </section>

   <section id=bit>
      <h2>Does Snap Backup use the archive bit?</h2>
      <p>
         No.&nbsp;
         The archive bit is not applicable to full backups, so Snap Backup ignores the archive bit
         and backups up files even if they have not changed since your last backup.&nbsp;
         (Additionally, the archive bit is platform dependent, and Snap Backup is designed to work
         on just about every major platform.)
      </p>
   </section>

   <section id=restore>
      <h2>Does Snap Backup have a restore feature?</h2>
      <p>
         No, that's not really necessary.&nbsp;
         Just double-click a "<code>.zip</code>" backup file, and your OS will expand the contents
         for you.&nbsp;
         Hopefully, you will find restoring to be an infrequent activity.
      </p>
   </section>

   <section id=disk>
      <h2>Can Snap Backup be used to backup up a hard drive?</h2>
      <p>
         No.&nbsp;
         The vast majority of files on your hard drive are operating system files and application
         program files that do not need to be backed up.&nbsp;
         Snap Backup is intended for frequent use in backing up just your valuable data not your
         entire hard drive.

      <h2>Which files and folders do I need to backup on macOS?</h2>
      <p>
         If you are a Mac user, check out this article for information on exactly which files and
         folders to backup:

   </section>

   <section id=usb>
      <h2>Can Snap Backup save my data to a portable USB drive?</h2>
      <p>
         Yes.&nbsp;
         One of the simplest external data devices you can use with Snap Backup is a portable USB
         drive.&nbsp;
         Just insert the drive into one of your USB ports and specify the USB drive's location in
         Snap Backup's "Copy Backup To:" option.&nbsp;
         On Apple macOS, USB drives show up in the "<code>Volumes</code>" folder with the name of
         the drive, such as "<code>/Volumes/MyData</code>".&nbsp;
         On Windows, the USB Drive will show up as a drive letter, such as <code>E:\</code>.
      </p>

   <section id=copy>
      <h2>Can Snap Backup copy files instead of compressing them into a zip file?</h2>
      <p>
         No.&nbsp; Simply copying files instead of zipping them up into a single file
         is certainly useful, but that capability is better suited to a copy utility
         instead of a backup utility.&nbsp; Additionally, Snap Backup is designed to be
         very easy to use, and adding a copy feature could undesirably complicate the
         user interface.
      </p>
   </section>

   <section id=profiles>
      <h2>Does Snap Backup support multiple profiles?</h2>
      <p>
         Yes.&nbsp; A typical use of multiple profiles is to backup your work files
         separately from your personal files.&nbsp; On the "File" menu, go to the
         "Multiple Profiles" item and select "On".
      </p>
   </section>

   <section id=filters>
      <h2>Does Snap Backup have filters?</h2>
      <p>
         Yes.&nbsp; Filters give you more control over exactly which folders and files
         to backup.&nbsp; The filters support wildcards ("*") and can also exclude
         files based on their size.
      </p>
   </section>

   <section id=automatic>
      <h2>Can Snap Backup schedule backups to happen automatically?</h2>
      <p>
         Yes, with some scripting.&nbsp; To facilitate launching backups from scripts and
         schedulers, Snap Backup can be
         run from the command-line.&nbsp; Use the scheduler included with for your operating
         system (for example, "cron" on Linux and "Scheduled Tasks" on Windows) to automate
         your backups.&nbsp; For instructions, see the "Command-Line Option" section in the
         <a href=../snap-backup-user-guide.html#command-line class=external-site>Snap Backup
         User Guide</a>.

   <section id=languages>
      <h2>What languages does Snap Backup support?</h2>
      <p>
         Snap Backup supports
         {% render 'website/templates/languages-text.html', webRoot: webRoot %}
         &nbsp;Snap Backup will attempt to detect your default language and
         use that if available.
      </p>
   </section>

   <section id=zip>
      <h2>Why does my zip utility launch whenever I try to run Snap Backup?</h2>
      <p>
         Some ill-behaved zip utilities for Microsoft Windows take over the file association for
         files ending in "<code>.jar</code>".&nbsp;
         The "<code>.jar</code>" file extension is the standard extension for a Java program
         (an executable <b>J</b>ava <b>AR</b>chive)
         and indicates the file should be opened by Java &mdash; <b>not</b> by a zip utility.&nbsp;
         The easiest way to fix this annoying problem is to just
         <a href=https://openjdk.org class=external-site>reinstall Java</a>, which automatically
         resets the "<code>.jar</code>" file association back to Java.&nbsp;
         If that does not work, look to see if your zip utility has an option in its preferences to
         release the "<code>.jar</code>" file association.
      </p>

   <section id=freeze>
      <h2>Snap Backup freezes on me.&nbsp; Why?</h2>
      <p>
         Snap Backup may have trouble completing the backup process if it encounters a problematic
         file, such as a file that is locked by another application or a file that is too huge to
         process.&nbsp;
         In such a situation, it is important to pinpoint which file is causing the problem.&nbsp;
         The last file listed in the <i>Message Log</i> section is likely the problematic file.
      </p>
      Troubleshooting Steps:
      <ol>
         <li>Enable Snap Backup's filtering feature.&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; In the <i>File</i>
            menu, choose the <i>Backup Filters</i> option and then select <i>On</i>.</li>
         <li>Create a filter to skip over the folder containing the file you believe
            is most likely to be the problematic file.&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; Click the
            <i>Edit Filter</i> button, and in the "Skip folders matching:" field, enter
            the folder name.&nbsp; Then click the <i>Ok</i> button.</li>
         <li>Test.&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; Click the <i>Do Backup Now</i> button to kick
            off the backup.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         If the backup hangs again, repeat the steps for a different folder.&nbsp;
         Note that the <i>Cancel</i> button is only able to abort in between processing files (it
         does not abort in the middle of processing a file).&nbsp;
         Sometimes this results in the <i>Cancel</i> button not being very responsive.
      </p>

   <section id=unidentified>
      <h2>How do I get past the "unidentified developer" security warning?</h2>
      <p>
         <b><i>&lt;control-click&gt;</i></b> the <code>.pkg</code> installer file.&nbsp;
         When attempting to install an open source Mac application, such as Snap Backup, you might
         encounter a message stating that the install file
         <i>"can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"</i>.
      </p>

         <img src=../graphics/developer-warning.png alt=security>
      </figure>
      <p>
         Macs provide a simple way to allow you to run such files &ndash; just
         <b><i>&lt;control-click&gt;</i></b> on the file and select "<b>Open</b>".

   <section id=upgrade>
      <h2>How do I upgrade to a new version of Snap Backup?</h2>
      <p>
         To upgrade your version of Snap Backup, simply install the new version.&nbsp;
         The new version will cleanly replace the old version, and all your backup settings will
         automatically be preserved.
