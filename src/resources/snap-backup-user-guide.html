<section id=best-practices>
   <h2>1) Best Practices</h2>
   People typically fail to backup their data frequently because:
   <ul>
      <li>They do not know which files to backup</li>
      <li>If a backup procedure is in place, it is inconvenient or takes a long time</li>
      <li>Resulting backup file is too big and cumbersome</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      Corporate system administrators have backup procedures for their company
      servers, databases, and network files.&nbsp; Individual computer users,
      on the other hand, are usually left to fend for themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
      The following strategies will help you create a backup procedure that is
      quick and easy.
   </p>
   Strategies:
   <ul>
      <li>Separate data (work files) from applications (program files)</li>
      <li>Store all data for backup under a single high-level folder</li>
      <li>Store large Multimedia files separately (for less frequent backups)</li>
      <li>Use Snap Backup to save your data (work) frequently</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Data vs. Applications</h3>
   <p>
      You have probably at some time been advised to backup your entire hard
      drive.&nbsp; While this may be appropriate for some people, it is
      impractical for most people.&nbsp; Even if the process uses "delta"
      technology, the resulting backup file is too huge to easily save and the
      process often takes a painfully long time.&nbsp; The reason for this
      is that the vast majority of the files on your hard drive are operating
      system files and application program files that do not need to be
      backed up.&nbsp; If one of your applications gets corrupted or
      uninstalled, you can reinstall it from the install CD or Internet
      download.&nbsp; What you really need to backup are the data files that
      store your work and configuration settings.&nbsp; For
      example, your word processor application might consume 100,000,000 bytes
      of space on your hard drive, but all your word processor documents
      combined might only consume one hundredth that amount.&nbsp; Your work
      documents, not your applications, are critical to backup
      regularly.&nbsp; Your work is important to you, so you should know where
      your data is located.&nbsp; Facilitate quicker backups by separating your
      data (work files) from your applications (program files).
   </p>
   <h3>Centralize Work Files</h3>
   <p>
      Make your backups easier to configure by putting your data (work files)
      into a single high-level folder, and name the folder something like
      "My Work" or "Data".&nbsp; Then when you backup your high-level data folder,
      you have backed up all your work.
   </p>
   <h3>Handling Large Work Files</h3>
   <p>
      Multimedia files, such as pictures and videos, present a special
      challenge because they are important to backup, but their size makes them
      cumbersome to backup frequently.&nbsp; For multimedia files and other large
      data files, create a folder called "Storage" or "Large Files" and put it
      next to (not into) your high-level data folder.&nbsp; While you backup your
      high-level data daily, you might only backup your storage folder weekly or
      monthly.
   </p>
   <h3>Make Backing Up Part of Your Daily Habit</h3>
   <p>
      Once you have Snap Backup configured to backup your data (work files),
      it is easy to backup your data daily.&nbsp; Snap Backup automatically
      puts the current date in the backup file name, alleviating you from the
      tedious task of renaming your backup file for each backup.&nbsp; Snap
      Backup also optionally copies your backup file to an external archive
      location.&nbsp; The backup file is a single compressed file that can be read
      by zip programs such as Unarchiver, gzip, 7-Zip, and Mac's built-in Archive
      Utility in the event that you need to restore you data files.
   </p>
</section>

<section id=getting-started>
   <h2>2) Getting Started</h2>
   <p>
      The first time you run Snap Backup, configure where your data files
      reside and where to save the backup files.&nbsp; You can also
      specify an optional archive location, such as a USB drive, for
      storing copies of the backup files.&nbsp; After saving your settings,
      they will be automatically available next time you run Snap Backup.&nbsp;
      Clicking the "Backup Now" button will start the backup process.&nbsp;
      Click the "Exit" button when the backup is finished.
   </p>
   <p>
      Tip: <i>The "Backup Now" button is the default button when
      Snap Backup starts up, and it can be fired by just hitting the
      "Enter" key.&nbsp; After the backup completes, "Exit" becomes the
      default button, so you can complete the entire backup process by
      launching Snap Backup and hitting "Enter" twice.</i>
   </p>
</section>

<section id=configuration>
   <h2>3) Configuration Settings</h2>
   <p>
      Configure Snap Backup to work in your specific environment with the
      settings described below.
   </p>
   <h3>Folder and Files to Backup</h3>
   <p>
      Use the "Add Folder or File" button to add a folder or file to the list of
      items to be backed up when you press the "Backup Button".&nbsp; If you
      specify a folder, all its contents (sub-folders and files) will be included
      in the backup.&nbsp; To delete a folder or file from the list, use the
      "Remove" button.
   </p>
   <h3>Save Backup (Zip) File Into</h3>
   <p>
      Enter the full name of the folder into which you wish to have the backup file
      placed.&nbsp; Enter the full name directly or use the button with the folder
      icon to browse for the desired folder.
   </p>
   <h3>Backup Name</h3>
   <p>
      Enter the file name of the backup file to be created, but do not include
      the "<code>.zip</code>" extension, which is appended automatically.&nbsp;
      Also do not include the folder path as that is specified in the "Save
      Backup (Zip) File Into" field.
   </p>
   <h3>Copy Backup To</h3>
   <p>
      Use the checkbox to specify whether or not to make a copy of the backup
      file.&nbsp; This feature is typically used to archive the backup file by
      copying it to a another location, like a USB flash drive (memory stick)
      or external hard drive.&nbsp;
      (Note: On macOS, USB drives show up in the "<code>Volumes</code>" folder with the
      name given to the drive, such as "<code>/Volumes/MyData</code>".&nbsp;
      On Windows, the USB Drive will show up under a drive letter, such as
      "<code>F:\</code>".)&nbsp;
      Enter the full name of the folder into which you wish to have the backup file copied.
   </p>
   <h3>Message Log</h3>
   <p>
      This area displays the names of the files add to the backup file and
      also displays any errors encountered while creating the backup.
   </p>
   <h3>Restore Default Settings</h3>
   <p>
      Use the "Restore Default Settings" button to reset your
      configuration settings to the original generic settings.
   </p>
   <h3>Backup Now</h3>
   <p>
      Use the "Backup Now" button to kick off the backup process.
   </p>
   <h3>Exit</h3>
   <p>
      Use the "Exit" button to close Snap Backup after your backup
      is complete.
   </p>
</section>

<section id=advanced-configuration>
   <h2>4) Advanced Configuration Settings</h2>
   <p>
   Some Snap Backup options need to be turned on from the "File" menu before
   they can be used.
   </p>
   <h3>Backup Filters</h3>
   <p>
      Use the filters to gain more control over exactly which files to include
      in your backup.&nbsp; Click the "Edit Filter" button to bring up
      to the filter editor and then create your rules.&nbsp; For example,
      an include rule set to "bookmarks.html" will mean that only files named
      "bookmarks.html" will be backed up.  The star character ("*") is the
      wildcard, so an include rule of "*.txt, *.xml" means only files with
      either the ".txt" or ".xml" file extension will be backed up.&nbsp; The
      exclude rule works in the opposite fashion.&nbsp; An exclude rule of
      "*cache*" means that all files with the "cache" in any part of their
      name will be skipped over and not included in the backup.&nbsp; The
      exclude rule takes precedence over the include rule.
   </p>
   <h3>Multiple Backup Profiles</h3>
   <p>
      If you have sets of files you want to backup separately, such as work
      files and personal files, then navigate to the "Multiple Profiles" option
      on the "File" menu and select "On".&nbsp; A "Backup Profiles" section
      will appear on the left side the Snap Backup window.&nbsp; Use the "New"
      button to create profiles with different backup settings.
   </p>
</section>

<section id=export-import>
   <h2>5) Export/Import Settings</h2>
   <p>
      Once you have your configuration settings properly setup, you should back them
      up so the settings can be restored if needed.&nbsp; Choose "Export
      Settings..." from the "File" menu to save your settings to a file.&nbsp;
      If you need to restore your previously saved settings, choose the "Import
      Settings..." also in the "File" menu.
   </p>
   <p>
      Note that settings relative to your home folder are restored using your
      home folder at the time of import.&nbsp; For example, if your user name is
      "michelle", you might configure Snap Backup to zip up the folder
      "/Users/michelle/Documents".&nbsp; If you export your settings and then
      import them on a system where your user name is "mjohnson", Snap Backup will
      adjust your settings to zip up the folder "/Users/mjohnson/Documents".
   </p>
</section>

<section id=command-line>
   <h2>6) Command-Line Option</h2>
   <p>
      To facilitate launching backups from scripts and schedulers, Snap Backup can be
      run from the command-line.&nbsp;
      The form of the command is:<br><br>
         <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
         $ java -jar snapbackup.jar &lt;profile_name&gt;
         </code><br><br>
      Replace "&lt;profile_name&gt;" with the name of the backup profile you wish to use.&nbsp;
      For example, the following command would be used to perform a
      backup with the settings for the "Spreadsheets" profile:<br><br>
         <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
         $ java -jar snapbackup.jar "Spreadsheets"
         </code><br><br>
      Use the "--current" option if you only have one profile or just want to use whatever
      profile is the current default profile.&nbsp;
      The command is:<br><br>
         <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
         $ java -jar snapbackup.jar --current
         </code><br><br>
      Use the "--list" option to display a list of all the profile names.&nbsp;
      The command is:<br><br>
         <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
         $ java -jar snapbackup.jar --list
         </code><br><br>
      Depending on how your computer is setup and where you have Snap Backup
      installed, you may need to specify the full path for "java" or
      "snapbackup.jar" or both.&nbsp;
      On most Windows systems, for example, you would use a command like:<br><br>
         <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
         &gt; java -jar "C:\Program Files\Center Key\Snap Backup\snapbackup.jar" --current
         </code><br><br>
      To schedule your backups on Windows to be performed automatically, create a one
      line file called "Snap Backup.cmd" containing the Snap Backup command.&nbsp;
      Then go into the "Control Panel" and open "Scheduled Tasks".&nbsp;
      From there, use "Add Scheduled Task" to "Browse..." to the "Snap Backup.cmd" file and
      schedule your backups.
   </p>
