Snap Backup Uninstall
=====================
Snap Backup does not modify any registry settings upon installation.  Being
very non-intrusive to your computer, Snap Backup is easy to uninstall.  Just
delete the following:

   1) Delete the "Snap Backup.lnk" link from your Desktop
   2) Delete the "Snap Backup" folder from your Start menu
   3) Delete the "C:\Program Files\Center Key Software\Snap Backup"
         folder and all its contents

Note that your backup settings are stored in the standard Java user
preferences location (JavaSoft\Prefs) in the registry.  It's completely
harmless to leave them there, but you can safely delete them at any time
if you like.
